`open-multi-agent` is a multi-agent orchestration framework for TypeScript backends. Give it a goal; a coordinator agent decomposes it into a task DAG, parallelizes independents, and synthesizes the result. Drops into any Node.js backend.

> **Your engineers describe the goal, not the graph.**

Graph-first frameworks make you enumerate every node and edge up front. `open-multi-agent` is goal-first: you describe the outcome and the coordinator builds the task DAG at runtime, so the orchestration adapts to the goal instead of being hand-wired for one.

## Get started

The fastest way to see it run — one command scaffolds a project and starts a multi-agent DAG:

```bash
npm create oma-app@latest
```

Answer one prompt; the first run shows the coordinator turn one goal into a multi-agent DAG and opens a dashboard of the run (OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible provider). To add the library to your own project:

```bash
npm install @open-multi-agent/core
```

The full quickstart, the three ways to run, provider setup, the production checklist, and the complete API reference live on the package page:

**→ [`packages/core/README.md`](packages/core/README.md)**

Prefer to run an example from the repo? Clone and run one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent && cd open-multi-agent
npm install
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
npx tsx packages/core/examples/basics/team-collaboration.ts
```

Three agents collaborate on a REST API while `onProgress` streams the coordinator's task DAG — independent tasks run in parallel, dependents unblock as their inputs land, and the coordinator synthesizes the final result. Local models via Ollama need no API key; see the [providers guide](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/providers.md).

Want a full application instead of a script? Two clone-and-run apps embed OMA in a real backend: an [Express REST API](packages/core/examples/integrations/express-customer-support/) and a [Next.js app](packages/core/examples/integrations/with-vercel-ai-sdk/). Or skip the local setup: the [Next.js deploy starter](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/oma-nextjs-starter) goes live on Vercel in one click.

## How is this different from X?

Most TypeScript teams picking a multi-agent layer are really choosing between OMA, LangGraph JS, and Mastra. The mechanism is what differs.

**vs. LangGraph JS.** LangGraph has you design a declarative graph (nodes, edges, conditional routing) up front, then compiles it into an invokable; OMA's Coordinator decomposes the goal into a task DAG at runtime and auto-parallelizes independents. Both checkpoint and resume, though LangGraph's persistence ecosystem runs deeper. Reach for OMA when the plan should adapt to the goal instead of being wired ahead of time.

**vs. Mastra.** Both are TypeScript-native; the difference is who drives orchestration. Mastra has you wire the workflow by hand. OMA is goal-driven: hand its Coordinator a goal and it builds the task DAG at runtime. `runTeam(team, goal)` in one call.

**vs. CrewAI.** CrewAI is the established multi-agent option in Python. OMA brings goal-driven decomposition to TypeScript backends with three runtime dependencies and direct Node.js embedding, with no separate Python service to stand up alongside your stack.

**vs. Vercel AI SDK.** AI SDK is the LLM-call layer (provider abstraction, streaming, tool calls, and structured outputs), not a multi-agent orchestrator. Use it alone for single-agent calls; reach for OMA the moment you need a coordinated team. OMA even ships an optional AI SDK bridge.

## Ecosystem

`open-multi-agent` launched 2026-04-01 under MIT. Known users and integrations to date:

**Built with OMA**

- **[temodar-agent](https://github.com/xeloxa/temodar-agent)** (~60 stars). WordPress security analysis platform by [Ali Sünbül](https://github.com/xeloxa). Uses our built-in tools (`bash`, `file_*`, `grep`) directly inside a Docker runtime. Confirmed production use.
- **[PR-Copilot](https://github.com/kidoom/PR-Copilot)**. AI pull-request review assistant by [kidoom](https://github.com/kidoom). Runs an OMA review team (coordinator + scoped reviewer agents), defines repo-context tools with `defineTool`, and adds a custom `ContextStrategy` for token-aware PR-diff compression. Public code on `@open-multi-agent/core`.

**Integrations**

- **[Engram](https://www.engram-memory.com)** — "Git for AI memory." Syncs knowledge across agents instantly and flags conflicts. ([repo](https://github.com/Agentscreator/engram-memory))
- **[@agentsonar/oma](https://github.com/agentsonar/agentsonar-oma)** — Sidecar detecting cross-run delegation cycles, repetition, and rate bursts.

**Provider community offers** — limited-time, not paid endorsements.

- **[MiniMax](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan?code=6ZoOY13DDV&source=link)** — Use MiniMax M3 in OMA's TypeScript multi-agent workflows. OMA users get 12% off the MiniMax Token Plan until 2026-06-30. See the [MiniMax setup guide](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/providers/minimax.md).

## Repository

This is a monorepo. The published package is **`@open-multi-agent/core`**, and it lives in [`packages/core/`](packages/core/) — the source of truth for the library, its tests, examples, and the npm package page.

npm install            # install all workspaces
npm run build          # compile packages/core
npm run lint           # type-check
npm test               # run the test suite
